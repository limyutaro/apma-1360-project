![Sandpile Avalanche](https://github.com/limyutaro/apma-1360-project/sandpile avalanche.png)

Final project on pattern formation in sandpile models. 
For the course Applied Dynamical Systems (APMA 1360), Brown University, Spring 2020. 

Explored patterns that emerge when sandpiles of different sizes topple to a stable configuration. Explored topples with perturbations of various types. Pictures and videos can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PnyIcbkhZcejMzWQg2ltOT-liygeqiMQ/view?usp=sharing.

Code uses functions in p5 library. If you don't already have those on your device, it is better to go straight to the p5 online editor at https://editor.p5js.org/limyutaro/sketches/gm5tyuvYc.
